# YTSwag: Better YouTube Music (BETA)

**NOTE: Project no longer actively maintained**
I've moved on to Spotify now, and hence don't get enough time to contribute to Youtube Music. Maybe one day I'll return to YTM if they implement some much necessary features on the backend side.
**I'll still accept PRs** but won't be actively contributing to this.

**Current Version: 0.4 beta**

This is a yet-under-construction project to add new features to Youtube Music! Beta version for testing available!

Oh, and accepting logo submissions. (Read: Begging for a good logo, I suck at design)

Also, accepting new feature ideas (create an issue or PR) as long as they can be feasibly implemented (offline mode, for one, cannot be feasibly implemented, atleast with a Chrome Extension).

Install via the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ytswag-better-youtube-mus/paegakmcpjcoihjndpgdbilmjbcjedhd)
or [install manually](#Installation).

## Current Features

1. Lyrics (From YouTube CC and Genius)
2. Hide/show subtitles (globally)
3. Hide/show queue
4. Double clicking song makes it play
5. Picture-in-Picture (PIP) mode for music videos (can be viewed accross multiple tabs and even windows!)
6. A VERY cool theme :)

## Installation

1. Download and Unzip or Clone the repo.
2. Click the Chrome menu icon and select Extensions from the Tools menu. Ensure that the "Developer mode" checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked.
3. Click on Load Unpacked, select the YTSwag directory (where you cloned/downloaded the repo) and Select Folder.
4. Make sure it is enabled.

## How Lyrics Work (as of now)

1. The extension first tries to get the official Closed Caption of the video if available, and present it as lyrics. Cause the Closed Captions has a timer, it's possible to know when the lyrics start and end, and highlighting is done.
2. As a backup, lyrics from Genius is taken in case CC is not available. This is done in a way similar to [SwagLyrics](https://github.com/SwagLyrics/SwagLyrics-For-Spotify).

## TODO list/Planned Features

- [ ] List available languages except english for CC Lyrics
- [ ] Add a Discord Rich Presence activity like Spotify
- [ ] Add Last.fm scrobbler
- [x] ~~Better media button controls, especially on Linux (?)~~ Youtube fixed it
- [x] ~~Better theme/theme engine~~ Implemented another theme

## Using

Given Genius will be accessed by you when the extension is used, you must comply by their [Terms of Use](https://genius.com/static/terms) if your use of YTSwag accesses their site.
They say that you should be authorized in writing by Genius except if it's content you legally uploaded there.
You should check out their official terms linked above to read the official document.
